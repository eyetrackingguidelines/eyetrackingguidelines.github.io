## INTRODUCTION
<br>
<p align="justify">
Our findings in a systematic review on eye-tracking publications in the ACM Digital Library, highlighted severe issues with how eye-tracking data has been analysed. In this page, we propose a set of recommendations for improving practices for designing and conducting studies involving the analysis of eye-tracking data. Our recommendations focus on the issues of highest concern in previous eye-tracking studies in the ACM Digital Library and provide a template for reporting the results of future studies. These recommendations shall serve as a minimum scientific quality assurance for research utilizing eye-tracking. Though we developed these recommendations based on the requirements of recent eye-tracking studies published in the ACM Digital Library, we note that they might not be suitable for all cases, due to the wide variety of types of papers involving eye-tracking data. We structured these recommendations based on different stages of a study from design to analysis.
