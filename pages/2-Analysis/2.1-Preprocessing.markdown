### Do not remove data that contains blinks as it will cause interaction delays.
<br>
<p align="justify">
We recommend against removing data that contains blinks. While this is the most predominant approach in the literature reviewed, it can depend on the window size, resulting in over 50\% of the data becoming unusable. It can also lead to temporarily suspending updates to the interactive system that takes more than double the time of set window size. While we acknowledge that interactive systems in human-computer interaction rely on blinks for various interactions, the susceptibility of blinks is subject to a variety of factors, like age, air pollutants, and time of day, among others, which could impact the accuracy of interactive systems. As such, we recommend not using blinks as a direct input method for interactive systems, but merely as a passive sensing modality.
