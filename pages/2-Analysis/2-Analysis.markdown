## ANALYSIS
<br>
<p align="justify">

To use eye tracking in interactive systems to its fullest potential, we need to do pre-processing beyond the abilities of the current parsers. Even when included parsers mark blinks, certain artifacts remain in the data. Removing windows/trials/instances where blinks are present will significantly decrease available data and introduce a delay in interactive systems. As such, we recommend the following processing steps for eye-tracking data.

Our recommentations apply independently of sampling frequency and type of eye tracker.
