## Cut off data with high variation preceding and following blink based on inspection of the given dataset.
<br>
<p align="justify">
We recommend inspecting the variation in speed [deg/ms] and variation in speed [deg/ms] preceding and following a blink. This will uncover any artifacts in the data related to blinks, as the moment the eye trackers identify a blink is a moment the eye trackers can no longer track the pupil. This leaves the data from where the eyelid moves down and up dependent on the sensitivity and settings of the eye tracker, whether this is included in the blink or not. Especially, visually inspecting the data allows for careful interpretation of the data. Using a linear function on the data of 300-150 msec preceding the blink and setting an epsilon enables us to set a cutoff point between relevant data and artifacts.
