## ANALYSIS
<br>
<p align="justify">
The first step in analysing EDA data is to preprocess it to remove artifacts and noise, and then parameterise raw EDA
values into EDA parameters. The two most common methods of parameterisation are peak detection and model-based
approaches. Peak detection is a simple analysis method, used mainly for manual EDA parameterisation; but it lacks
reliability in the case of superimposed SCRs [15]. Model-based approaches are automated methods that solve the
    superimposed SCR problem.</p>
